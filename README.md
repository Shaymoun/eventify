# Eventify App

This project is simple frontend app, that allows users to browse, add, edit and delete events.

I'm following simple git commits convention:

Template:

`<type>:<description>`

Types:

`feat` is for adding a new feature
`fix` is for fixing a bug
`refactor` is for changing code for peformance or convenience purpose
`chore` is for everything else (writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, cleaning useless code etc.)
